AI-Powered Mobile Stock Screener and Advisory Platform
📌 Project Overview

AI-Powered Mobile Stock Screener and Advisory Platform is a mobile application that empowers retail & professional investors to make data-driven stock market decisions through natural language queries, real-time analytics, and AI-powered insights.

Users can ask questions like:

“Show me all NSE stocks with PE below 5 and promoter holding above 50 and positive earnings for the last 4 quarters.”

The backend interprets natural language using LLMs, translates it into validated screening logic, compiles it into optimized SQL, and returns actionable insights instantly.
